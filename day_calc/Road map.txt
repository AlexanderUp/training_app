Road map for dayCalc kivy application.

================================================================================

** DONE!!! Button 'Include last day' to be added.

** DONE!!! Button 'Today' for last date to be added.

** Functionality for calculating dates with number of days passed since / left to specified date to be added.

** Code should be refactored! Logic should be separated from UI.

** DONE!!! 'Calculate' button to be deprecated.

** In case of using 'today' check box and changing the date manually after it, 'tick' from check box should disappear.
Note! Implementation postponed due to conflict in logic of using checkbox.
