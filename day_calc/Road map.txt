Road map for dayCalc kivy application.

DONE!!! Button 'Include last day' to be added.

DONE!!! Button 'Today' for last date to be added.

Functionality for calculating dates with number of days passed since / left to specified date to be added.

Code should be refactored! Logic should be separated from UI.

'Calculate' button to be deprecated.
